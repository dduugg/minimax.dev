# Work towards solving Ultimate Tic Tac Toe

Over the last few months, I've been working on solving [Ultimate Tic Tac Toe][wikipedia], also known as (Tic Tac Toe)Â². I've made considerable progress, but, as of this writing, am still some distance away from the solution being feasible in an amount of compute time and money I'm willing to spend. This section of the site is dedicated to documenting my work so far and some next steps.

Solving Ultimate Tic Tac Toe isn't a particularly important goal in and of itself, but I've found this project a great opportunity to learn about a fairly wide range of topics; I'm hopeful this writeup can bring some of those lessons to others who have similar interests, or just who want to follow along with a nerdy deep-dive into game tree search and high-performance Rust while we're all stuck at home.

If you're unfamiliar with the game of Ultimate Tic Tac Toe, start with [my writeup](the-game) of the game. Otherwise, jump to the introduction on [Proof-Number search](pn-search).
