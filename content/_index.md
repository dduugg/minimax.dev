# Welcome to minimax.dev

Hello!

I'm [Nelson Elhage](https://nelhage.com/), and one of my hobbies is
learning about and implementing game AIs and related algorithms. This
website is the home for my writing on the topic, hopefully covering
both some introductory and educational material on the topic, as well
as writeups of some of my own projects.
