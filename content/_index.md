# Welcome

Hello!

I'm [Nelson Elhage](https://nelhage.com/), and one of my hobbies is
learning about and implementing game AIs and related algorithms.

I've created this website as the home on the internet for my writing
on the topic, so I have a place to share the things I've learned and
work I've done. I'm hopeful to eventually include a lot of
introductory material and referenes to background and further
information, as well as writeups of my projects.

For now, the main thing here is a work-in-progress [writeup of my
ongoing attempt to solve Ultimate Tic Tac Toe](/docs/ultimate). You
probably want to start there.
