# Welcome

Hello! I'm [Nelson Elhage](https://nelhage.com/), and one of my hobbies is learning about and implementing game AIs and related algorithms.

For now, the main thing on this site is a writeup of [my ongoing attempt to solve Ultimate Tic Tac Toe](/docs/ultimate). You probably want to start there.

Eventually, though, I hope to write up additional information on game AI and tree search and various other algorithms, as well as some writeups of [Taktician][taktician], my other high-performance game AI.
